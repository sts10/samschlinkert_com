      <h2 class="section_title" id="twitter_bot">build a Twitter bot</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing running right now, but for a few March Madnesses <a href="https://github.com/sts10/ncaa_upset_bot">a bot of mine alerted the Twittering masses to possible upsets</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="section_title">manage passwords</h2>
      <p>
        I love my password manager and <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2017/06/27/keepassxc-setup-guide.html">I want you to as well</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="section_title">check if passwords have been compromised </h2>
      <p>
        I wrote <a href="https://github.com/sts10/medic">a command-line tool in Rust</a> that let's users check their passwords against <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned</a> and <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2019/02/01/medic.html">wrote about it</a>.

      <h2 class="section_title">analyze Russian disinformation Twitter data</h2>
      <p>
        One day I took a break from CNN's social accounts to parse 9 million tweets from the Internet Research Agency, contributing to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/20/politics/most-popular-russian-campaign-trolls/index.html">CNN's story</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section_title">work with password hashes</h2>
      <p>
        Totally legal, <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2018/05/31/1password-cracking-challenge.html">totally legal</a>. 
      </p>
      <h2 class="section_title">build Slack bots</h2>
      <p>
        Can't link to these because they're for CNN, but I wrote one of them in Rust and it was *chef kiss*. Using Python 3 now though.
      </p>
      <h2 class="section_title" id="scrape">scrape a website</h2>
      <p>
        If it's public and has reasonable CSS, there's a decent chance I can scrape it? I've used Nokogiri, Beautiful Soup, even Node.js and Cheerio. Here's the story of <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/05/08/website-scraped.html">a sentimental and doomed scraping journey</a>.

      <h2 class="section_title">manage two-factor authentication on a shared account</h2>
      <p>
        Ever need to enable two-factor authentication on an account that multiple colleagues in five bureaus on three continents need to be able to get in to? You might have a use for <a href="https://github.com/sts10/qr-forge">this command-line tool I wrote</a>.
        <h2 class="section_title">convince you to buy a $200 keyboard</h2>
        <p>
          The tools we use every day are <a href="https://medium.com/adventures-in-consumer-technology/my-latest-obsession-mechanical-keyboards-ef9e28089327">so, so important</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section_title">write tweets to 50 million followers</h2>
        <p>
          I've been a social producer at CNN since 2015! I mostly work on the CNN Facebook account, but I also compile and analyze social media analytics using various tools, including some I wrote in Rust and Ruby. I previously held similar positions at BuzzFeed News and The Daily Beast.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section_title">write a barebones blog CMS </h2>
        <p>
          During <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">the resurgence of "Tilde Clubs"</a> in 2014 I wrote <a href="https://github.com/sts10/radiation">a simple blog CMS in Ruby</a>. Other people used it! It was a big deal for me at the time!

        <h2 class="section_title">query an API</h2>

        <p>
          I don't publish much flowery prose these days, but <a href="https://schlinkblog.tumblr.com/post/6304492430/today-june-7th-marks-the-last-day-on-the-lease">Tumblr circa 2011 was different</a>.

          Can I get a PGP key onto a Yubikey? <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/12/07/yubikey-and-gpg.html">Yes</a>. Would I want to do it again? Not particularly (I'm rooting for newer alternatives, like <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2020/09/08/exploring-age-and-rage.html">age</a>).

        <p>
          We should all use pass<em>phrases</em> for passwords. <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2020/09/30/making-a-word-list.html">I used Google Books Ngram data to make a list of words for creating said passphrases</a>. I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/sts10/tidy">a separate tool to clean word lists</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sts10/nametag">another one to use them to generate random usernames</a>.
