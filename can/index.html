            <p>
                We should all use pass<em>phrases</em> for passwords. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/sts10/phraze">a passphrase generator</a>, which uses <a href="https://github.com/sts10/orchard-street-wordlists">a number of word lists I created</a>.

            <p>
                One day I took a break from CNN's social accounts to parse 9 million tweets from the Internet Research Agency, contributing to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/20/politics/most-popular-russian-campaign-trolls/index.html">CNN's story</a>.

                If it's public and has reasonable CSS, there's a decent chance I can scrape it? I've used Nokogiri, Beautiful Soup, even Node.js and Cheerio. Here's the story of <a href="https://sts10.github.io/2016/05/08/website-scraped.html">a sentimental and doomed scraping journey</a>.

                <p>
                    I was a social producer at CNN from 2015 till 2021! I mostly worked on the CNN Facebook account, but I also compiled and analyzed social media analytics using various tools, including some I wrote in Rust and Ruby. Before that, I held similar positions at BuzzFeed News and The Daily Beast.
