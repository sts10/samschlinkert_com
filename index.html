		<p>
			Hello! My name is Sam Schlinkert. I live in New York where I am currently a student at the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>, a coding bootcamp focusing on Ruby. The two years prior to that I was the Deputy Social Media Editor at <a href='http://www.thedailybeast.com' target="_blank">The Daily Beast</a>.

  	<div class="section_title" id="social">Social Media Editing</div>
          
    <p>
      In the fall of 2011 I joined the social team at <span class="newsweek">Newsweek</span> & The Daily Beast. After the sale of <span class="newsweek">Newsweek</span> to IBT Media in the fall of 2013, I stayed on with The Daily Beast as the Deputy Social Media Editor until January of 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
      My responsibilities at The Daily Beast included:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        	Managing the <a href="http://cheatsheet.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr blogs</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/newsweek" target="_blank">Twitter feeds</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thedailybeast" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/100212953676424405273/posts" target="_blank">Google+</a> pages of The Daily Beast (when IAC still owned <span class="newsweek">Newsweek</span> I managed <span class="newsweek">Newsweek</span>&#8217;s social accounts as well)
        </li>
        <li>
        	Soliciting readers&#8217; opinions on various topics <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/07/do-you-care-that-the-nsa-is-spying-on-you.html" target="_blank">using customized forms</a> and developing <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/21/why-we-own-guns.html" target="_blank">creative ways of displaying the results</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        	Covering breaking news with tools like Storify (<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/01/reports-shooting-at-lax.html">&ldquo;Three Shot at LAX&rdquo;</a>) and Livefyre (<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/01/live-blog-48-hours-in-cairo.html">&ldquo;Live Blog: Egyptian Army Ousts Morsi&rdquo;</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
        	Setting up and customizing the theme code for multiple Tumblr blogs, such as <a href="http://picturedept.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Picture Dept</a>, <a href="http://nwkarchivist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">NWKArchivist</a>, and <a href="http://theporkbarrel.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">The Pork Barrel</a>
        </li>
     <!--    <li>
        	Overseeeing freelance community moderators to improve the quality of comments on the site</li>
        <li>
        	Writing internal documents such as weekly statistical reports and social media guidelines, how-tos, and strategy overviews
        </li> -->
    </ul>


    <p>
      In 2013 our small social team at The Beast was <a href="http://winners.webbyawards.com/2013/social/social-content-and-marketing/news-information/the-daily-beast-social" target="_blank">nominated for a Webby</a> in the News &amp; Information category.
    </p>
   
    <p> 
   	  In my younger days I ran some fun Tumblrs, including <a href="http://blakelivelydoingthings.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Blake Lively Doing Things</a>, <a href="http://kitchencountersyoucouldfuckon.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Kitchen Counters</a>, and <a href="http://hashtaghashtag.com/" target="_blank">The ##</a>.
  	</p>
  	
    <div class="section_title" id="coding">Web Design and Interactives</div>
  	<p>
  		While I've been tinkering around with HTML and CSS since I was in my early teens, the first time I coded for a real audience was at <span class="newsweek">Newsweek</span> & The Daily Beast, starting in 2011. 
			<br><br>
			<img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/avatar_ce116ecec5ef_128.png" style="width: 70px; float:left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;">At NewsBeast I was a part of an informal group called <a href="http://newsbeastlabs.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Newsbeast Labs</a> that produced interactives to add depth to news stories. These interactives included maps, charts, grapics... anything that went beyond standard text and photos. In December of 2012 the Labs group was <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/what-newsweeks-digital-future-will-look-145942" target="_blank">interviewed for AdWeek</a>. 
			<br><br>
			While my official title at Newsbeast was Deputy Social Media Editor, I very much enjoyed working with editors and reporters to make their stories more impactful through the use of basic web design.

			<br><br>
			I've also designed some Tumblrs and websites, both for <span class="newsweek">Newsweek</span> & The Daily Beast and as a freelance designer.

        	In September of 2013 Congress was gearing up for a vote on whether to use military force against Syria's President Assad. Editors at The Daily Beast wanted a graphical way to represent different politicians&#8217; views on the issue. 
        	<br><br>
        	For this project I started with code written by Michael Keller, a former co-worker, for a <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/12/michael-moore-glenn-beck-more-edward-snowden-opinions-interactive.html" target="_blank">project that displayed differing opinions on Edward Snowden</a>.  
        	<br><br>
        	This interactive has some cool things going on behind the scenes. Using the <a href="http://misoproject.com/">Miso Project</a>, it pulls information from an associated csv spreadsheet. <br><BR>
        	<IMG SRC="http://i.imgur.com/tSM8vjE.png" style="border: 1px solid #000; width:50%; float:right; margin: 3px 0 5px 15px;">
        		
        	The spreadsheet has a unique row for each person, with columns for name, title, image location, x and y positions on the grid, and any information displayed in the hover windows. By using Miso in this way, it's easier for those not comfortable editing code to create and edit the content of the interactive using Excel or Google Docs.

    			In 2012 the photo department at <span class="newsweek">Newsweek</span> & The Daily Beast wanted to start a Tumblr to showcase some of the great photography that didn&#8217;t quite fit in the print product or on the website. I worked with the photo editors to create a completely custom Tumblr theme geared toward showing these images in a simple design that stayed out of the way.  
    			<br><br>
    			Fun fact: During all my work on the theme, I listened to Nicki Minaj&#8217;s &ldquo;Moment 4 Life&rdquo; on repeat.

    			Amid the mass-walks outs and protests over low wages in the fast-food industry that took place in the summer of 2013, I worked with a reporter and editor at The Daily Beast to look into the relationship between fast-food prices and employee pay. 
    			<br><br>
    			After consulting two economists, I developed a little app that allows users to select how much more they'd be willing to pay for a Big Mac. Once the user selects a value, they automatically see how much above the $7.25 minimum wage workers can make as a result, and whether that gets them over the official poverty line.
    			<br><br>
          I wrote <a href="http://newsbeastlabs.tumblr.com/post/58247528927/this-month-saw-big-news-from-the-fast-food" target="_blank">a lengthy post on the Newsbeast Labs Tumblr</a> detailing how I approached and executed the project.

    			On the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy hitting the east coast, The Daily Beast photo editors wanted a way to show how well we've rebuilt. We decided that using a slider to drag between two photos taken from the same perspective a year apart would be the best way to do this.
