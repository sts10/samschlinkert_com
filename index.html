		<p>
    Hello! My name is Sam Schlinkert. I live in New York where I am a social media editor and programmer. I am currently a Social Media Producer at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/" target="_blank">CNN</a>, focusing mainly on publishing to Facebook and social media analytics. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Previously, I was an Associate Social Media Editor for <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/news" target="_blank">BuzzFeed News</a>. Prior to that I attended the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>, a coding bootcamp working with the Ruby programming language. And before that I was the Deputy Social Media Editor at <span class="newsweek">Newsweek</span> & <a href='http://www.thedailybeast.com' target="_blank">The Daily Beast</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		  You can find me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sts10" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://github.com/sts10" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and, if you must, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samschlinkert" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. From time to time I update a <a href="http://sts10.github.io/" target="_blank">programming blog</a> where I write about interesting applications, text editors, JavaScript, Ruby, and other Internet stuff.

      In the spring of 2014 I attended <a href="http://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">The Flatiron School</a>, a coding bootcamp where I studied Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Below are some of my favorite Ruby projects (although I've since dabbled in Python as well). You can read about my experiences in web development over on <a href="http://sts10.github.io/" target="_blank">my programming blog</a>.

        In early October of 2014, I became fascinated with Tilde Clubs, a name for shared UNIX servers in-part <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">coined by Paul Ford</a>. I quickly joined one of these clubs called <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/">totallynuclear.club</a> (here's <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/~schlink">my tilde page</a>) and eventually developed a basic blog CMS that I called <a href="https://github.com/sts10/radiation">Radiation</a>. It's a simple command line interface written in Ruby that allows users to create "posts" in Markdown or HTML, then "publish" these posts in reverse-chronological order to an index.html file.
        <br><br>
        It's been a wonderful and very rewarding experience to have others use my program (including totallynuclear.club founder, <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/~erik/">~erik</a>), suggest improvements, and submit pull requests.

        As a social media editor at <span class="newsweek">Newsweek</span> & The Daily Beast, we had a rule-of-thumb that if we saw one link tweeted by two different people you follow, it was probably something important. But once I started spending more and more time programming, I would miss these important links. 
        <br><br>
        To solve this problem, a partner and I built <a href="http://squawkbot.heroku.com/" target="_blank">SquawkBot</a>. (Note: The app may be down until I re-launch it on Heroku or elsewhere.) This Rails app uses the Twitter REST API to get the last 1,000 tweets for a user's timeline and finds URLs that appear more than once. I wrote a blog post in two parts to explain our process (<a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/04/21/squawkbot-connecting-to-twitter/">part one</a>, <a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/04/24/squawkbot-part-2-extracting-urls/">part two</a>).

        A fellow student and I set out to make a Skillshare-like platform for the Flatiron community. XP is a Ruby on Rails web app that allows users to create lessons-- either as a student or a teacher. 

        <br><br>

        Users can also search for upcoming lessons using a select box I built using <a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/04/02/chosen/">Chosen</a>, a jQuery library. We also implemented the Rails <a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/04/12/data-remote-true/">"data-remote true" pattern</a> to post lesson comments using AJAX. Almost all of the app was built using test-driven development. Currently most of the app's functionality is only accessible to members of the Flatiron community, however you can <a href="https://vimeo.com/92742438">watch a demo</a>.

    After finishing Flatiron School, I did some freelance consulting work for <a href="http://www.shareablee.com/" target="_blank">Shareablee</a>, a social media analytics start-up in New York. Using Python, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank">the Flask framework</a>, the Facebook API, and <a href="http://nvd3.org/" target="_blank">NVD3</a> I analyzed how their customers used Facebook posts, displayed the information visually, and allowed potential customers to connect their insights data and compare their numbers against the compiled benchmarks.

These interactives included maps, charts, graphics... anything that went beyond standard text and photos. In December of 2012 the Labs group was <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/what-newsweeks-digital-future-will-look-145942" target="_blank">interviewed for AdWeek</a>. 
			<br><br>
			While my official title at Newsbeast was Deputy Social Media Editor, I very much enjoyed working with editors and reporters to make their stories more meaningful through the use of basic front-end web design.

			<br><br>
			I've also designed some Tumblrs and websites, both for <span class="newsweek">Newsweek</span> & The Daily Beast and as a freelance designer. For more of my front-end work, checkout my <a href="#games">JavaScript Games section</a>.

        	In September of 2013 Congress was gearing up for a vote on whether to use military force against Syria's President Assad. Editors at The Daily Beast wanted a graphical way to represent different politicians&#8217; views on the issue. 
        	<br><br>
        	For this project I started with code written by Michael Keller, a former co-worker, for a <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/12/michael-moore-glenn-beck-more-edward-snowden-opinions-interactive.html" target="_blank">project that displayed differing opinions on Edward Snowden</a>.  
        	<br><br>
        	This interactive has some cool things going on behind the scenes. Using the <a href="http://misoproject.com/">Miso Project</a>, it pulls information from an associated CSV spreadsheet. <br><BR>

        	The spreadsheet has a unique row for each person, with columns for name, title, image location, x and y positions on the grid, and any information displayed in the hover windows. By using Miso in this way, it's easier for those not comfortable editing code to create and edit the content of the interactive using Excel or Google Docs.

I worked with the photo editors to create a completely custom Tumblr theme geared toward showing these images in a simple design that stayed out of the way.  
    			<br><br>
    			Fun fact: During all my work on the theme, I listened to Nicki Minaj&#8217;s &ldquo;Moment 4 Life&rdquo; on repeat.

    			Amid the mass-walks outs and protests over low wages in the fast-food industry that took place in the summer of 2013, I worked with a reporter and editor at The Daily Beast to look into the relationship between fast-food prices and employee pay. 
    			<br><br>
    			After consulting two economists, I developed a little app that allows users to select how much more they'd be willing to pay for a Big Mac. Once the user selects a value, they automatically see how much above the $7.25 minimum wage workers can make as a result, and whether that gets them over the official poverty line.
    			<br><br>

        Here are a few little games I've built using JavaScript and jQuery. Some of them are works-in-progress, but each one has a few good snippets of code.

              A frustrating little game where the objective is to run out of numbered squares (similar to "Shut the Box"). As a challenge to myself I didn't use jQuery-- just plain ole JavaScript. Writing the code to figure out when the user had lost was <a href="http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/05/30/strike-9-game/">a fun puzzle</a>, involving a lot of array manipulation. (And yes, it is <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/j269yluf1a3pqi9/2014-09-10%20at%206.15%20PM.png">possible to win</a>.)

            My extended family has a long tradition of playing an eccentric version of gin rummy called "Contract." Keeping score can be a bit involved, so I used jQuery to make an interactive score card.
